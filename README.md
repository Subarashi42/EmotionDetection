A real-time **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** system designed to assess student engagement during virtual or in-person learning sessions. The model classifies emotions into:

> **Engaged, Disengaged, Surprise, Neutral, and Frustration**

Using your webcam, the system draws a bounding box around detected faces, with **color-coded emotion feedback**. At the end of a session, it generates a summary of emotional trends over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FER_Engagement.git
cd FER_Engagement
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧠 Model Generation

Since the model file is too large to store in this repository, **you'll need to generate it manually**:

👉 **Run this notebook to train and save the FER model:**

```bash
Models_Evaluation_Finished_CNN.ipynb
```

This will produce a trained CNN model file (e.g., `emotion_model.h5`) and save it for use in the real-time detection program.

## 🎥 Real-Time Emotion Detection

To launch the real-time facial emotion recognition system:

👉 **Run this notebook:**

```bash
Emotion_program.ipynb
```

This notebook will:

* Activate your **webcam**
* Detect faces and classify emotions in **real time**
* Draw a **bounding box** around the face with color representing the emotion:

  * 🟩 **Engaged**
  * 🟦 **Disengaged**
  * 🟨 **Surprise**
  * ⬜ **Neutral**
  * 🟥 **Frustration**

When the session ends (or you manually stop it), a summary report will display the **emotional distribution** tracked during the session.

## 📊 Emotion Summary Report

After running the program, you'll see a visual breakdown of the emotions detected over time.

Example Output:

## ✅ Emotion Labels

| Label           | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Engaged**     | Student appears focused and attentive |
| **Disengaged**  | Low attention, distracted             |
| **Surprise**    | Sudden emotional response             |
| **Neutral**     | Passive or blank expression           |
| **Frustration** | Confused or struggling expressions    |
